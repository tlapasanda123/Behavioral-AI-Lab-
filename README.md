Sample Work (Module 5 – Data Analysis)
This is an Excel file that summarizes different flower measurements for specific flower varieties. To properly create and clean different flower measurements, each flower variety was separated into respective tables to categorize their respective measurements and allow cleaner comparison and analysis across each variety. Then, tasks such as cleaning the borders on tables, adjusting table width and height, and creating different tables to separate each measurement was added including its sepal/petal length and widths and its descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, minimum, etc.) 
Upon further analysis, it can be inferred that the Virginica flower often appears to have longer sepal lengths with a mean of 6.6 (assuming each unit = in centimeters) and a maximum length of 7.9 cetimeters. Meanwhile, the Setosa flower appears to have the shortest petal widths, displaying a mean of 0.2 centimeters and a maximum of only 0.6 centimeters (compared to the other flower varieties: versicolor = 1.8 centimeters and virginica = 2.5 centimeters). Other inferences can be made using different flower measurements, but these two observations clearly highlight the distinctive qualities of each flower.
